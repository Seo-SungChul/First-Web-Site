        <br>You're just too good to be true
        <br>Can't take my eyes off of you
        <br>You'd be like Heaven to touch
        <br>I wanna hold you so much
        <br>At long last, love has arrived
        <br>And I thank God I'm alive
        <br>You're just too good to be true
        <br>Can't take my eyes off of you
